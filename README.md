# pomodoro-timer
An application that helps people work using the pomodoro technique written in C++. 

In order to run the application, simply clone this repository, navigate to the directory containing these files, and execute the pomodoro file.          

One way to do this is to navigate to the pomodoro-timer directory and type: 
```
./pomodoro
```
in a bash terminal to run the application. 

While it is unlikely, the pomodoro file may not be executable. 
To resolve this, simply type
```
chmod +x pomodoro
```
into a bash terminal window.
